    <p class="p1234">Magnus Carlsen, in full Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen, (born November 30, 1990, Tønsberg, Norway), Norwegian chess player who in 2013, at age 22, became the second youngest world chess champion.

    Carlsen’s father first taught him how to play chess when he was five years old. He played in his first tournament at the age of eight. Carlsen finished second in the boys’ under-12 division at the 2002 Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) World Youth Chess Championship, held in Iráklion, Greece.

        In January 2004 he won his first tournament, at Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands. Although he was playing in the lowest-rated group against adult players, his domination of the tournament, best exemplified in a game won with a 29-move checkmate, established him as a player with enormous potential and led American chess player Lubomir Kavalek to dub him the “Mozart of chess.” In March of the same year, at a blitz chess tournament (where the game is played at a much faster pace than normal) in Reykjavík, he defeated former world champion Anatoly Karpov and drew a game against another former champion, Garry Kasparov. He became a grandmaster after finishing in second place at the Dubai Open Chess Championship in April 2004.
        
        Carlsen came in 10th at the 2005 World Chess Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, thus becoming the youngest player to earn a place at the Candidate Matches in Elista, Russia, in 2007, where the top four players received a spot at the FIDE World Chess Championship later that year in Mexico City. However, he was defeated in the first round by Armenian chess player Levon Aronian (who went on to place seventh at the world championship).

       Carlsen’s victory at the Pearl Spring Chess Tournament in Nanjing, China, in October 2009 with 8 out of a possible 10 points was considered one of the all-time best tournament performances. In November he won the World Blitz Championship in Moscow.

        In January 2010 FIDE announced that Carlsen was the top player in the world. He had recently turned 19 and was thus the youngest player to become number one. That year he was hired by the Dutch clothing company G-Star to model its denim clothing in an advertising campaign. Carlsen surprised the chess world in November 2010, when he decided to forgo the 2011 Candidate Matches to select a challenger to play against Indian chess player Viswanathan Anand for the world championship, arguing that the championship structure was flawed and that the reigning champion should not receive an automatic spot in the final round.

        However, Carlsen participated in the 2013 Candidates Tournament in London. Despite losing in the final round to Russian player Peter Svidler, he accumulated enough wins earlier in the tournament to best Russian player Vladimir Kramnik (who had the same number of points) and secure the challenger spot against Anand. In November 2013 Carlsen defeated Anand in 10 games at the world championship match in Chennai, India, with a score of 3 wins and 7 draws. Carlsen was the second youngest player (after Kasparov) to win the world title. He successfully defended his title in a rematch against Anand in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, with a score of 3 wins, 7 draws, and 1 loss. At the 2016 world championship in New York, he was tied against Russian player Sergey Karjakin after 12 games. He defeated Karjakin by winning 2 games in a 4-game rapid round, in which each player had only 25 minutes on the clock, with 10 seconds added after each move. Carlsen clinched his victory with style on the last move of game 4 by sacrificing his queen to set up checkmate on the next move.

        From the very beginning of his career, Carlsen impressed his coaches with a prodigious memory, which he has used in his career to play a large variety of openings. He favours a positional style of play in which overall control of the board, rather than attacking an opponent’s pieces, is of paramount importance.</p>
